git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.

### SPA (Single Page App) Routing / 404 on Refresh

If you deploy this app (React Router + Vite) to static hosting and refresh a non-root route (e.g. `/about-us`), you may see a 404 because the server tries to fetch `/about-us/index.html` which does not exist. Fixes:

- Netlify: add a `public/_redirects` file with: `/* /index.html 200` (already included).
- Vercel: use `vercel.json` with a catchâ€‘all rewrite to `/index.html` (already included).
- GitHub Pages: add a `404.html` that loads the SPA. The build script copies `index.html` to `404.html` automatically.

Build script enhancement: `npm run build` now also creates `dist/404.html` for hosts (like GitHub Pages) that serve the 404 page for unknown paths.

If you use another platform, ensure there is a fallback rewrite so every unknown path serves `index.html`.
